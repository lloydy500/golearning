How Computers Work

- computers run on electricity
- electricity can be on or off
- coding scheme - if the porch light is on, come trick or treat
- circuit, switch, transitor all mean the same

- 1 porch light means 2 messages, ON == 'come in' OFF == 'go away'
- 2 porch lights = 4 messages
- 3 porch lights = 8 messages
- 4 porch lights = 16 messages
...

this is the concept of base2 or BINARY

- 2^n where n is the number of circuits/switches/transistors
- 1 means on, 0 means off
